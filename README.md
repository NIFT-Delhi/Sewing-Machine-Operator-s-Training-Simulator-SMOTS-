Sewing is a process of converting a 2D element, fabric, to a 3D product, garment.
Sewing is a process of converting a 2D element, fabric, to a 3D product, garment. However, the process is complicated owing to the variation in material (fabric types) and process parameters (sewing speed, sewing direction, contour of sewing, etc. ). Sewability of each fabric varies owing to the variation in their handle properties, like shear, drape, compression, etc.. Thus requiring sewing operators to be acquainted with the doâ€™s and don'ts while handling each fabric type during sewing which necessitates prior training. This project would aim at developing an AR platform where sewing operators can comprehend the handling of fabric during the process of sewing before they hit the sewing floor for actual sewing operation. This interactive guide would provide an immersive experience. This needs trifurcation of the sewing activity 1. feeding of thread and machine setting, 2. feeding in the fabric underneath the presser foot through the feed dog of the sewing machine, 3. sewing the fabric and 4. feeding out the fabric post completion of sewing under the sewing head.
